Turktools
=========

Summary:
--------
collection of html templates and R visualization and analysis script, to be combined with python scripts to streamline experiment design, deployment, and basic data analysis.
 

Project description:
-------------------- 
A series of free, open-source tools designed to assist linguists in the process of creating, posting, and analyzing online experiments using grammaticality surveys, picture-matching tasks, completion tasks, and
covered-box tasks, with diverse designs using binary forced choice, Likert scales, slidebars, and drop-down menus. The tools assist with the creation of HTML templates for the experiments, randomization and list-creation, and basic visualization and data analysis. The resulting surveys can be posted on Amazon Mechanical Turk or hosted on the experimenterâ€™s own server. 

* Kotek conceived of project, came up with desiderata. 
* Kotek created html template skeletons and R visualization and analysis script.
* Kotek designed and wrote algorithms for Python code as well as some patches. 
* Code and server component implemented by Michael Yoshitaka Erlewine, MIT.


Folder includes: 
----------------
* R data visualization and analysis script
* template skeletons folder (html)
* python scripts 
* sample items files
