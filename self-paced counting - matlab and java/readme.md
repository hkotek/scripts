Self-Paced Counting ("Colors") experiment
=========================================

Summary:
--------
Modified Matlab code for sentence processing experiment, eventually reported as Experiment 3 in Kotek, Hadas, Yasutada Sudo, Edwin Howard, and Martin Hackl. 2011. [Most meanings are superlative](https://hkotek.com/kotek2011a.pdf). Syntax and Semantics 37: Experiments at the Interfaces, ed. Jeff Runner, 101â€“145. Bingley, UK: Emerald Publications. Dot arrays for this experiment originally generated using a java-based program called Beehive.  	
  
  
 Project description: 
--------------------
This experiment compared the real-time processing sensitivity of the quantifiers *most* and *more than half* to the number of colors in a dot array against which a statement like "more than half/most of the dots are blue" is verified. We confirmed the hypothesis that *most* will display such a sensitivity but *more than half* will not. This lends support to our analysis of *most* as related to *the most* and distinct from *more than half*, going against the prominent view in the literature.  

 * Matlab and java code by Akimitsu Hogge at MIT. 
 * Kotek supervised work, wrote algorithms to facilitate workflow.
 * Kotek created test datasets to test code.
 * Kotek customized code for the "colors" experiment as described in log.txt.
 * Kotek designed the "colors" experiment and created its documentation.
