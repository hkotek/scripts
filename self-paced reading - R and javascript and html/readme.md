Self-Paced Reading scripts
==========================

Summary:
--------
R script for self-paced reading task, and modified javascript and HTML files used in experiment design. Eventually reported as Experiment 3 in my dissertation, Kotek, Hadas. 2014. Composing Questions. Massachusetts Institute of Technology, as well as in my MIT Press 2019 book of the same title.	


Project description: 
--------------------
This experiment tested the sensitivity of English questions to the presence of so-called "interveners" - in this case, the presence of the word "also". It has been shown in other languages that interveners block certain word orders from appearing in questions: a question word cannot appear downstream of an intervener. This hasn't been tested in English. The experiment shows that the presence and position of "also" affects the processing of multiple questions (e.g. "which student read which book?") but not questions with quantifiers (e.g. "which student read every book?"), lending support to the theory of questions developed in the dissertation/book, where the syntax of questions may be more complex than it appears from surface word order.
