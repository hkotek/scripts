Rating study scripts
====================

Summary:
--------
R script for rating task, as well as html templates for posting on Amazon's Mechanical Turk, and design document for the study. This experiment was eventually reported as Experiment 2 in Kotek, Hadas, Yasutada Sudo, and Martin Hackl. [Experimental investigations of ambiguity: The case of *most*](https://hkotek.com/Kotek2015.pdf). Natural Language Semantics 23(2): 119â€“156. (R script modified and expanded from a script by Yasutada Sudo.) 


Project description:
-------------------- 
This experiment compared the sensitivity of the quantifiers *most* and *more than half* to the number of colors in a dot array against which a statement like "more than half/most of the dots are blue" is verified. We replicate our previous finding that *most* will display such a sensitivity but *more than half* will not, and furthermore show that the particular ratios of colors have a quantifiable and predictable effect on the results.
