Rating study scripts
====================

Summary:
--------
R script for rating task, as well as html templates for posting on Amazon's Mechanical Turk. Study eventually reported as Experiment 2 in Kotek, Hadas, Yasutada Sudo, and Martin Hackl. Experimental investigations of ambiguity: The case of most. Natural Language Semantics 23(2): 119â€“156. (Modified and expanded from a script by Yasutada Sudo.)


Project description:
-------------------- 
This experiment compared the sensitivity of the quantifiers "most" and "more than half" to the number of colors in a dot array against which a statement like "more than half/most of the dots are blue" is verified. We replicate our previous finding that "most" will display such a sensitivity but "more than half" will not, and furthermore show that the particular ratios of colors have a quantifiable and predictable effect on the results.
