Changed output path for target+practice Colors files so that MST and MTH results are collected in the same folder. 

=========================

Script made compatible with both windows and OSX. (In RunExperimentWithoutInstructionsAndPractice.m)

=========================

- Modified the color green in drawList.m to [0 140 0]

- Added 1 break to the colors experiment after 60 trials, 1 break to the priming experiment after 40 trials. 

=========================

Modified drawList.m to make squares as big as circles


=========================

fixed the two remaining Beehive bugs:
- the regexp problem
- the break problem.  Breaks are now another parameter set in the main
experiment function (e.g., in ColorsMST).

The new script is updated on dropbox and is attached here as well.

We now have a new script with several changes I've made, which I'll summarize below:

1. *Randomization *(function: ShuffleGroups): the randomization function was
not being seeded automatically by Matlab. Now fixed so we are in fact
presenting stimuli to different participants in different orders.

2. *Pseudo-randomization* (function: ShuffleGroups): code fixes so that it
does not crash if there are more target items than filler items.

3. *Preempt *(function: RunExperiment): it is now possible to not allow
participants to answer before seeing all of the shapes in a given stimuli
(this used to make the program get stuck).

4. *Resizing*: (a) the *cover size* has been increased so the covers are now
large enough to actually cover the shapes (function: DrawList).  (b) in
order to *rescale *the shapes to a good size, we now use the following
definitions: width = 0.20, height = 0.20; shape size = 0.4 (input file).

5. *Answer to question 2* (function: WriteFile): when no Q2 is asked, the
results file now leaves the column IsCorrect2 blank, instead of returning
"incorrect".

6. *New additions*: instead of using different versions of Yasu's script for
each version of each experiment, we now have an easier *setup*.

In dropbox and in the zipfile attached we now have a folder called
"SharedExperiments".
Inside "SharedExperiments", all of the Beehive scripts are in the "scripts"
folder.
Each experiment has its own short control script, for example PRM.m or
ColorsMST.m.
The control script refers to an instruction file and designates input and
output file names.
Each experiment has its own instructions file in the "scripts" folder.
The are also "input" and "output" folders where we can save our input and
output files.
To use these scripts with your own experiment, it should be easy to follow
what was done for PRM or ColorsMST or ColorsMTH.
